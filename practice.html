Hasan started his journey from Dhaka by taking a bus to Cox’s Bazar1. The bus ride was long but comfortable, and he enjoyed the scenic views along the way. After reaching Cox’s Bazar, he checked into a hotel and decided to explore the city.

He visited several tourist spots in Cox’s Bazar, including the famous Cox’s Bazar Sea Beach, Saint Martin, Maheshkhali, Inani Sea Beach, Himchari, Chera Dwip, Sonadia Island, Radiant Fish World, and Shapuree Island/Shah Porir Dwip2.
